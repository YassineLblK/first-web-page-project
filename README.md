An interface of Login/Sign Up of a web page.

I worked only on Fronted-end of this page.

This is the fisrt web page appears in front of the user when he open some pages that ask him to login if he have already an account or sign up if he hasn't one, 
created with HTML and I added some transitions using CSS and some interactions with the user using JavaScript, I added the possibility to change the mode 
of the background by clicking on the button on the bottom of the page.
